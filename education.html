                The project aims to improve the experience of educators and
                students when having class via video-conferencing softwares. We
                want to create an interface that connects educators and
                students.

              <h3>Observation</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Through several participants observation sessions, we defined
                problems that students are currently facing in a virtual
                educational environment.
              </p>

              <br />
              <p>
                The inability for presenters and participants to engage and have
                dialogue with one another is a major issue with video
                conferencing. The lack of low risk, non-disruptive,
                simple-to-use features that allow participants to comfortably
                engage with presentations results in lower levels of engagement.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                This lack of engagement is especially troublesome for
                presentations with educational objectives as engagement is a
                necessary component for learning.

              <h3>Mental Model</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Based on findings from participants observation, we defined the
                mental model for "having an online class on video conferencing
                tools" to select groups of people whom we want to focus on to
                provide a tailored experience to users.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                We listed distinguishing tasks and grouped them where there is
                behavior affinity. At this stage, we would like to define
                actors. And we named the groups and wrote an description.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
            </div>

              <h3>Persona</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Based on the task-based audience segments, we defined three
                personas.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                In order to keep it manageable within the allotted time frame,
                we selected core groups to focus for this project.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                For presenters, we decided to target those with low and medium
                prior knowledge of video-conferencing tools , as well as those
                who look forhigh participation from their audience. For
                participants, we targeted both shy and active participants that
                are focused on the presentation.

          <p>
            Via Zoom (in order to be familiar with remote UX processes), we
            carried out the 10 plus 10 method of generating design concepts.
            First, we didnâ€™t constrain the technology feasibility and the layout
            of our possible designs, rather we explored all possible design
            options.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            After several sessions, we settled on a single column interface
            which doesnâ€™t incorporate video conferencing tools. We wanted our
            system to be used by anyone, no matter their choice of
            video-conferencing platform. From that, we generated many ideas
            about the style and format of the interface, namely where key
            features like raising hand or emoting would go.

            We loved all our designs and wanted to have all the features.

             We will design high-fidelity prototypes and conduct more usability testings with users. We will also run the heuristic evaluation!
