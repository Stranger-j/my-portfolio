                The coronavirus outbreak has pushed many canadian colleges to
                move classes to an online format. The project aims to improve
                the experience of educators and students when having class via
                video-conferencing softwares. We created an interface that
                connects educators and students.

              <h3>Observation</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Through several participants observation sessions, we defined
                problems that students are currently facing in a virtual
                educational environment.

              <p>
                The inability for presenters and participants to engage and have
                dialogue with one another is a major issue with video
                conferencing. The lack of low risk, non-disruptive,
                simple-to-use features that allow participants to comfortably
                engage with presentations results in lower levels of engagement.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                This lack of engagement is especially troublesome for
                presentations with educational objectives as engagement is a
                necessary component for learning.

              <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                While many software had features that engage participants, no
                software provided any features for participants to react and
                engage in a presentation without garnering overwhelming
                attention and/or being disrupting, while still being easily
                visible to the presenter.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                Via our proposed system, presenters will be able to interpret
                participant engagement with ease through our proposed real time
                visualization and aggregation of participantâ€™s reactions and
                responses This eliminates the need for presenters to switch to
                different tabs or change the view mode to engage more
                comfortably with participants.

              <br />
              <p>
                Based on findings from participants observation, we defined the
                mental model for "having an online class on video conferencing
                tools" to select groups of people whom we want to focus on to
                provide a tailored experience to users.

                We listed distinguishing tasks and grouped them where there is
                behavior affinity. At this stage, we defined actors, named the
                groups (actors) and wrote an description.

              <p>
                Based on the task-based audience segments, we defined three
                personas.

                In order to keep it manageable within the allotted time frame,
                we selected core groups to focus for this project.

              <br />
              <p>
                For presenters, we decided to target those with low and medium
                prior knowledge of video-conferencing tools , as well as those
                who look forhigh participation from their audience. For
                participants, we targeted both shy and active participants that
                are focused on the presentation.

            Via Zoom (in order to be familiar with remote UX processes), we
            carried out the 10 plus 10 method of generating design concepts.
            First, we didnâ€™t constrain the technology feasibility and the layout
            of our possible designs, rather we explored all possible design
            options.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            After several sessions, we settled on a single column interface
            which doesnâ€™t incorporate video conferencing tools. We wanted our
            system to be used by anyone, no matter their choice of
            video-conferencing platform. From that, we generated many ideas
            about the style and format of the interface, namely where key
            features like raising hand or emoting would go.

            The design has undergone some revision in light of the feedback we
            had received from the usability testing with our paper prototype.
            Therefore, based on findings from the usability testing with our

                We conducted additional usability testing with the hi-fi
                prototype that users can interact with all functionalities. This
                round of usability testing consists of tasks, pre and post-test
                questionnaire on participants' backgrounds and subjective
                feedback on the system.

              <br />
              <p>
                Even though we refined our design iteratively, we still received

                font size.

              <br />
              <p>
                Based on the formative feedback we have received, we made
                several main modifications to our design: 1) bigger font, 2)
                graph labels, and 3) simplified graphs.

                Throughout this project, I've learnt that UX designers should be
                able to prioritize user needs. UXers are the ones who represent
                users in the entire project. It was easy to forget what users
                really wanted and needed during the process, and sometimes they
                are not even in the conversation. (i.e. while discussing the
                feasibility of each function) However, whenever I encountered
                the situation, I've tried to put users' needs at the top of the
                list by referring to the personas and mental model we defined.

                The usability testing and evaluation methods are mandatory steps
                to minimize the gap between users' mental models and conceptual
                models of systems and increase the overall usability. However,
                it was not easy to gauge the effectiveness and ease of use of
                the graphs during the study. As this kind of information
                visualization comes with interactive and dynamic graphics, I was
                able to assess its usability with the alpha system (working
                prototype), in the late design phase. The graphs' design was
                done based on the academic literature; however, there are not
                sufficient numbers of usability studies focusing on data
                visualization. In the future study, I would like to conduct
                testings to figure out users' preferences on the graphs given
                the context (e.g. A/B testing).
