          <h2>Foriegn language learners and subtitled videos</h2>
          <p>
            The study originally consisted of a laboratory experiment in which
            non-native speakers watch subtitled videos with the playback speed
            dynamically adjusted based on eye movement data. Under the
            supervision of Prof. Karyn Moffatt, I designed the whole project and
            completed a pilot study with web-based eye-tracking software.

            However, due to the pandemic that seems never-ending, we pivoted
            this research to the qualitative research that includes user
            behavior observation and semi-structured interviews.

          <h2>Usability evaluation of Canadian open data portals</h2>
          <p>
            The study consists of a comprehensive literature review on the
            usability of open data portals, the analysis of current portals and
            interviews with experts in the field.

          <p>
            I conducted the literature review on the usability of the open data
            portal and designed usability goals, matrics and interview
            questions.

            The study was conducted as a mini research project of "research
            design and principles" course. Due to the pandemic, the data
            analysis is based solely on the quantitative portion of the study,
            using the questionnaire as a research instrument. During the
            project, I designed survey questions and conducted the data analysis
            and visualization with Python.
