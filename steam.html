              <h3>Target users</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Through several participants observation sessions, we defined
                problems that students are currently facing in a virtual
                educational environment.
              </p>

              <br />
              <p>
                The inability for presenters and participants to engage and have
                dialogue with one another is a major issue with video
                conferencing. The lack of low risk, non-disruptive,
                simple-to-use features that allow participants to comfortably
                engage with presentations results in lower levels of engagement.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                This lack of engagement is especially troublesome for
                presentations with educational objectives as engagement is a
                necessary component for learning.

              <h3>Usability evaluation plan</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                While many software had features that engage participants, no
                software provided any features for participants to react and
                engage in a presentation without garnering overwhelming
                attention and/or being disrupting, while still being easily
                visible to the presenter.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                Via our proposed system, presenters will be able to interpret
                participant engagement with ease through our proposed real time
                visualization and aggregation of participantâ€™s reactions and
                responses This eliminates the need for presenters to switch to
                different tabs or change the view mode to engage more
                comfortably with participants.

          <p>
            Via Zoom (in order to be familiar with remote UX processes), we
            carried out the 10 plus 10 method of generating design concepts.
            First, we didnâ€™t constrain the technology feasibility and the layout
            of our possible designs, rather we explored all possible design
            options.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            After several sessions, we settled on a single column interface
            which doesnâ€™t incorporate video conferencing tools. We wanted our
            system to be used by anyone, no matter their choice of
            video-conferencing platform. From that, we generated many ideas
            about the style and format of the interface, namely where key
            features like raising hand or emoting would go.

              <br />
              <p>
                Based on findings from participants observation, we defined the
                mental model for "having an online class on video conferencing
                tools" to select groups of people whom we want to focus on to
                provide a tailored experience to users.

              <br />
              <p>
                We listed distinguishing tasks and grouped them where there is
                behavior affinity. At this stage, we defined actors, named the
                groups (actors) and wrote an description.

                In order to keep it manageable within the allotted time frame,

                For presenters, we decided to target those with low and medium
                prior knowledge of video-conferencing tools , as well as those
                who look forhigh participation from their audience. For
                participants, we targeted both shy and active participants that
                are focused on the presentation.

            We loved all our designs and wanted to have all the features.
