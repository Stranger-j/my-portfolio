                Despite that Steam has the highest number of active users and
                has been leading the game industry, its website is poorly
                designed. Users often feel disorientated when finding
                information on the website, since the information on the website
                is not properly organized, and too many visuals are randomly
                displayed. Therefore, by conducting usability testings, our team
                decided to evaluate the website's usability and find out better
                ways to organize information and provide a more intuitive and
                tailored experience to users.

                This usability testing target population is the younger
                generation who are currently between 18-39 years old and own a
                personal computer to enjoy gaming. According to the sales,
                demographic and usage data of 2018 from the Entertainment
                Software Association, the average gamer is 34 years old. Based
                on the same source of data, the main device to play a game is a
                personal computer (41%), followed by smartphone (36%) and
                dedicated game console (36%). Based on the target user group, I
                built two personas for this project.

              <br />
              <p>
                While many software had features that engage participants, no
                software provided any features for participants to react and
                engage in a presentation without garnering overwhelming
                attention and/or being disrupting, while still being easily
                visible to the presenter.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                Via our proposed system, presenters will be able to interpret
                participant engagement with ease through our proposed real time
                visualization and aggregation of participantâ€™s reactions and
                responses This eliminates the need for presenters to switch to
                different tabs or change the view mode to engage more
                comfortably with participants.

          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            Before we conduct usability testings with users, we have two
            usability evaluation sessions: heuristic evaluation and cognitive
            walkthrough. Each team member, including myself, conducted
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            After several sessions, we settled on a single column interface
            which doesnâ€™t incorporate video conferencing tools. We wanted our
            system to be used by anyone, no matter their choice of
            video-conferencing platform. From that, we generated many ideas
            about the style and format of the interface, namely where key
            features like raising hand or emoting would go.

                Based on findings from participants observation, we defined the
                mental model for "having an online class on video conferencing
                tools" to select groups of people whom we want to focus on to
                provide a tailored experience to users.

                We listed distinguishing tasks and grouped them where there is

                For presenters, we decided to target those with low and medium
                prior knowledge of video-conferencing tools , as well as those
                who look forhigh participation from their audience. For
                participants, we targeted both shy and active participants that
                are focused on the presentation.
