                Despite that Steam has the highest number of active users and
                has been leading the game industry, its website is poorly
                designed. Users often feel disorientated when finding
                information on the website, since the information on the website
                is not properly organized, and too many visuals are randomly
                displayed. Therefore, by conducting usability testings, I
                evaluated the website's usability and found out better ways to
                organize information by providing a more intuitive and tailored
                experience to users.

                personal computer to enjoy gaming. According to the sales,
                demographic and usage data of 2018 from the Entertainment
                Software Association, the average gamer is 34 years old. Based
                on the same source of data, the main device to play a game is a
                personal computer (41%), followed by smartphone (36%) and
                dedicated game console (36%). Based on the target user group, we
                built two personas for this project.

                three companies have the standalone launcher, there is a
                CTA(Click-To-Action) button to download a launcher. In addition,
                to help users to find a game from tons of products, games are
                categorized by various criteria, but three companies have a
                filtering option by genre.

          <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough and Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            Before we conducted usability testings with users, we had two
            usability evaluation sessions: heuristic evaluation and cognitive
            walkthrough. Each team member, including myself, conducted these two
            testings individually and have findings aggregated.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            For the heuristic evaluation, we evaluated the system based on
            <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"
              >Jakob Nielsen's 10 heuristics</a
            >
            and used the tool <a href="https://www.heur.io/"> "Heurio"</a> which
            helps us to make comments on the website that we evaluate. When
            evaluating heuristics of the website, we used severity ratings and
            added detailed desciptions to share findings with the team. This
            allowed us to assess the various problems easily even if we have not
            found them in our own evaluation session.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            And for the cognitive walkthrough, we made a template on Google docs
            and aggregated findings there. To conduct a cognitive walkthrough,
            first, we defined 6 specific steps of purchasing a game and all 4
            questions were answered in each step.

          <p>
            After completing the above steps, we found TOO MANY USABILITY
            PROBLEMS! üò± Steam's IA is awful (it has two navigation bars!), the
            user experience is horrible (The only way to you continue shopping
            is to go back to the home page and resume the whole process), and is
            cluttered, chaotic and otherwise distracting interfaces! (Too many

            As purchasing a game and organizing game collections are the main

            decided to improve the user experience from visiting Steam website
            to completing order.

              <br />
              <p>
                Before we conduct usability testing, we develop the test plan
                that includes scope, purpose, schedule, sessions, participants,
                scenarios and metrics. Our testing plan is built on the template
                from
                <a href="https://www.usability.gov/"> usability.gov </a>
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                The main scenario is to purchase a game, and the scenario
                consists of 6 tasks. During the test, I will measure "successful
                task completion", "Critical errors", "Time on task" and
                "perceived ease of use" After users complete tasks that we ask,
                they will be asked to have a 15-min semi-structured interview to
                further understand their subjective feedback, likes, dislikes
                and recommendations.

                questions, usability goals and metrics, task description,
                observer guidelines, test script, user introduction, data
                collection sheet(observation), pre-test and post-test
                questionnaire.

            Even though we prepared the comprehensive test plan, we wanted to

            feedback and assess their performance during the test. Moreover, we
            believed that conducting the mock usability test helps us be trained
            as test facilitators and observers. This step allowed us to refine
            the test materials again so that we valued every single time that
            participants were willing to take them out of their day.

              Critical to a project‚Äôs success is empathizing with the users so
              that we can fully understand and solve their problems. Refining
              the prototype with product validation allowed me to analyze such
              perspectives closely. A major part of my role in this project was
              research planning and documentation. I learned to re-frame the
              questions when the team encountered a roadblock related to users
              being unable to complete certain validation tasks.

              Some users gave subjective feedback that didn‚Äôt truly reflect

              completion time and continuously met errors in the prototype, they
              still gave it an overall higher rating. As a UX Researcher, I had
              to prompt the users to explain why they were evaluating the
              product in a certain way. I also had to analyze and improve the
              testing script so that it focused more on their actual experience.
